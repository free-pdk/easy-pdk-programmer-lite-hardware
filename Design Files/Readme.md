This folder contains the design files that are needed to order the EaskyPDKProg lite at JLCPCB.

You need to upload these three files on the order page when prompted:

 - *Gerber_PCP.zip* - Gerber files with the PCB layout
 - *PickAndPlace_PCB* - The pick and place file
 - *BOM_EasyPDKPROGlite* - Bill of Materials

The parts listed in *Parts to order at LCSC* can not be automatically assembled and need to be ordered separately at LCSC. You can use their BOM tool to simplify ordering.
